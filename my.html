        <h2>Background Information</h2>
        <p>Pearl Harbor, located on the island of Oahu in Hawaii, served as a crucial naval base for the United States in the Pacific Ocean. Its strategic importance stemmed from its position as a hub for the deployment of American naval power in the region, as well as its proximity to key Pacific territories and shipping lanes.</p>
        <p>In the years leading up to December 7, 1941, tensions between the United States and Japan were escalating due to Japan's aggressive expansionist policies in the Pacific region. Japan sought to establish dominance and secure access to critical resources by annexing territories such as Manchuria, China, and parts of Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>Unwilling to back down from its territorial ambitions, Japan saw the attack on Pearl Harbor as a means to cripple the United States Pacific Fleet and establish dominance in the Pacific. In the early hours of that fateful day, Japanese aircraft carriers launched a surprise aerial assault on the unsuspecting naval base, catching the American forces off guard.</p>
        <p>The attack resulted in significant devastation, with numerous ships sunk or damaged, including battleships such as the USS Arizona and USS Oklahoma, hundreds of aircraft destroyed, and over 2,400 American military personnel and civilians killed. The events of Pearl Harbor marked the entry of the United States into World War II, changing the course of history.</p>
        <p>The attack on Pearl Harbor remains one of the most infamous acts of aggression in modern history, serving as a poignant reminder of the cost of war and the importance of vigilance in the face of threats to peace and security.</p>
